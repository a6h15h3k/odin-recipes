        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>First Half</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Setup an emotional beat that will justify everything we do for the rest of this recipe.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wn3RHVpfxE" target="_blank"> Classic intro song</a> to set the atmosphere</li>
            <li>Add Shahrukh and Kajol(SRKJo). Wait for them to caramelize with romance.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSvIOyw8zOo" target="_blank">Romantic song</a> for the feels</li>
            <li>Add a whole bunch of pre-prepped family burden for conflict.</li>
            <li>Start preparing a secondary character that will help bring the dish together towards the end. Let’s call this ingredient ‘Rohan’(or any other 90’s name)</li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/2gFcTb72OmM" target="_blank">Introduction song</a> for Rohan</li>
            <li>At this point your pan might be too hot so we need to separate it into 2 pots to bring down the heat.</li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/bzSTpdcs-EI" target="_blank">Emotional song</a> to add some saltiness with those tears.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Interval</h3>
            <ul><li>Due to the length of this recipe, please take a short break and grab some snacks/drinks.</li></ul>

        <h3>Second Half</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/jiZucsVVCp8?t=8" target="_blank">Item Song</a> so everyone knows things are not that serious, accompanied with light female objectificaion.</li> 
            <li>Now that your dish has had some time to cool off, we will add ‘Rohan’ to SRKKJo combo.</li>
            <li>Due to the chemical nature, they might not want to mix(this is in fact real science, do not try to think otherwise).</li>
            <li>So we will add JL to bring the fluffiness up and add a pinch of secondary conflict to bind them together.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://youtu.be/e_0Q92a8Wlo" target="_blank">Conflict Song</a> to speed things up. This will be used later in your workouts.</li>
            <li>Please mix the 2 halves together and stir until your able to differentiate what’s what.Your dish is now ready to be shoved down people’s throats as gospel.</li>
            <li>An <a href="https://youtu.be/gQnG_T7kbtY" target="_blank">End Credits Song</a> to bring it all together. This will have no relation to what we did for the last 8 1/2 hours of this recipe.</li>
        </ol>
